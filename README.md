# DrakeVisualizer

This package provides a Julia interface to the Drake Visualizer, part of the [Drake](http://drake.mit.edu) project and built on top of [Director](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/director), a highly customizable 3D interface for robotics visualization and interaction.

# Usage:

This package makes use of [GeometryTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/GeometryTypes.jl) to represent robot geometries and [AffineTransforms.jl](https://github.com/timholy/AffineTransforms.jl) to represent spatial transformations. Check out [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/rdeits/DrakeVisualizer.jl/blob/master/demo.ipynb) for some examples of usage.
